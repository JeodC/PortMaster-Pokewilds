## Mods
Mods can enhance the look and gameplay. Some notable mods:

- [Gen 3 Overhaul Mod by BansheeStudio](https://github.com/BansheeStudio/PokemonWildsGen3Overhaul)
- [Pokewilds Android via Termux by Kuze2571](https://github.com/Kuze2571/Pokewilds-Termux)

More mods can be found on the [Pokewilds Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jdkV7F3AjA).

## Notes
This game has a large RAM footprint and uses more memory over time. Therefore it has been classified as an `ultra` port and will only run efficiently on Retroid Pocket 5, Retroid Pocket Mini, RetroDeck, etc. However, it *should* also run well on any device with more than `2GB` of memory like the Anbernic RG552.
